# Intel App Roadmap

This folder tracks the development progress of the Intel App, detailing goals, challenges, and achievements over a planned two-month timeline. Weekly updates and progress reports are documented in separate files within this folder.

## Development Timeline: 2 Months
### Date: 10 Feb 2025 - 10 April 2025

## Month 1: Core Development & AI Agent Implementation

### Goals
- Identify and integrate a tool that fetches all Celo-based liquidity pools that support cUSD.

- Develop a mechanism to evaluate and select the most profitable staking pool.

- Set up a user-friendly frontend to facilitate interaction with staking pools.

- Enable users to manually stake their cUSD in chosen liquidity pools.

- Implement authentication for secure user access.

- Design an AI agent that dynamically selects the optimal staking pool and automates the staking process.

- Enable the AI agent to unstake from a pool and reallocate funds to a better-performing pool automatically.

**Note:** In this phase, we are utilizing the user's wallet to stake directly in liquidity pools without an intermediary staking smart contract. Once this system is fully functional, we will introduce a dedicated staking smart contract.

### Achievements
- âœ… Successfully integrated a tool to fetch all Celo-based liquidity pools that support cUSD.

- âœ… Developed an algorithm to evaluate and select the most profitable staking pool.

- âœ… Built an interactive frontend for staking operations.

- âœ… Enabled manual staking of cUSD into selected liquidity pools.

- âœ… Implemented authentication for user security.

- âœ… Developed an AI agent for automated staking pool selection and execution.
