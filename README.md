## Introduction
An AI-driven staking protocol that automatically allocates cUSD into liquidity pools, maximizing returns and fully optimized.

## Problem Statement

In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), users often face challenges when trying to optimize their staking and liquidity pool allocations. These challenges include:
- **Complexity**: Manually identifying the best liquidity pools and adjusting stakes requires significant time and expertise.
- **Risk**: Without proper analysis, users may allocate funds to suboptimal pools, leading to lower returns or increased risks.
- **Lack of Automation**: Most existing solutions require constant manual intervention, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.

Intel addresses these issues by providing an automated, AI-driven solution that simplifies the process of staking and optimizing yields.

## Solution

Intel introduces an **AI-powered yield optimization protocol** specifically designed for the Celo ecosystem. The key features of Intel include:
- **Automated Allocation**: An intelligent algorithm continuously monitors market conditions and reallocates cUSD across liquidity pools to maximize returns.
- **Risk Management**: Advanced risk assessment ensures that funds are allocated only to low-risk, high-performance pools.
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: The AI agent dynamically adjusts allocations based on real-time data, ensuring optimal performance at all times.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive dashboard allows users to track their investments, earnings, and portfolio health effortlessly.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of Intel are:
1. **Maximize Returns**: Ensure users earn the highest possible yields on their cUSD stakes.
2. **Minimize Risk**: Protect user assets by avoiding volatile or underperforming liquidity pools.
3. **Simplify Staking**: Provide an easy-to-use platform that eliminates the need for manual intervention.
4. **Promote Accessibility**: Make advanced yield optimization tools accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.

## Technologies Used

 1. **Frontend:** Nextjs, Tailwind CSS
 2. **Blockchain:** Celo
 3. **Blockchain integration:** ThirdWeb, Ethers.Js
 4. **ORM:** Prisma
 5. **API integration:** DeFiLlama API

## Workflow

1. Using the DeFiLlama API, the platform fetchs all Celo-based liquidity pools that support cUSD.
2.  A specialized algorithm analyzes and identifies the most profitable pool from the fetched data, optimizing returns.
3.  AI agents automatically verify whether the user has staked in the best pool. If not, the system executes the stake on behalf of the user, ensuring a hands-free, optimized DeFi experience.

## How Intel works

1. **Account Creation** – The user signs up for an Intel account using their email.

2. **Wallet Generation** – Upon registration, an Intel wallet is automatically created for the user.

3. **Depositing Funds** – The user deposits cUSD into their Intel wallet. If they choose to have the AI agent manage staking, they simply transfer funds to the AI wallet.

4. **Real-Time Notifications** – Users receive instant email notifications, keeping them informed of all AI-driven staking activities and transactions.
